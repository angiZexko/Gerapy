# Slendytubbies Beta V2 32 Bit: A Horror Game with a Twist
 
Slendytubbies is a re-make of the popular indie game "Slender", with a massive twist. Like the slender game, this game was made in the 3D Unity Engine. Don't be afraid to download, they're teletubbies, they're harmless and non-scary... Right? (WRONG)

Slendytubbies Beta V2 32 Bit is a game that will challenge your nerves and your sanity. It is not a game for children or for those who are easily disturbed by gore and violence. It is a game for those who enjoy a good scare and a good laugh at the same time. It is a game that will make you scream "Oh my god, it's a teletubby!"
  
The game has received mixed reviews from players and critics. Some praised the game for its originality, creativity and humor, while others criticized the game for its poor graphics, glitches and lack of scares. Some also found the game to be too disturbing and offensive, as it portrays the beloved children's characters in a gruesome and violent way.
 
One player commented on YouTube: "This game is hilarious and terrifying at the same time. I love how they made the teletubbies look so creepy and evil. The sounds they make are also very funny and scary. The game is not very hard, but it is very fun to play with friends online."
 
Another player commented on ZeoWorks: "This game is awful. It is not scary at all, it is just stupid and disgusting. The graphics are terrible, the gameplay is boring and repetitive, and the slendertubby is not even scary, it is just annoying. The game also crashes a lot and has many bugs. This game is a waste of time and space."
 
A critic from New.c.mi.com wrote: "This game is an interesting experiment in horror gaming. It takes a familiar and innocent concept and twists it into something dark and horrifying. The game has some flaws, such as low-quality graphics, unstable performance and lack of variety, but it also has some strengths, such as originality, creativity and humor. The game is not for everyone, but it is worth a try for those who are looking for something different and challenging."
